UNFILTERED AI (Prototype)

A personal AI assistant project exploring adaptive memory, emotional grounding, and dimensional reasoning.

🚧 Project Status: EARLY DEVELOPMENT

This repository contains a very early prototype of an AI personal assistant.
The codebase is functional enough to run a console-based assistant that:

talks conversationally

remembers past interactions (short-term & long-term)

stores journal entries with emotional analysis

can retrieve memories to maintain continuity

uses a "compassion-first" system prompt

begins experimenting with a dimensional reasoning scaffold inspired by cognitive axes

However — the architecture, files, and methods are still rough.
This project started as a self-learning path, and the current code reflects that.

If you are browsing this repo, expect inconsistencies, missing abstractions, and rapid experimentation.

🌱 Project Vision

UNFILTERED AI is not meant to be a standard chatbot.
Its long-term goal is to become a human-centered companion model that can:

provide grounded emotional feedback

learn from a user’s journal and behavior patterns

maintain continuity across conversations

help users stay stable, reflective, and intentional

eventually support adaptive scheduling, habit prediction, and personalized cognitive tools

The goal is not to create a general-purpose AGI but a focused companion intelligence.

A large part of the vision involves exploring dimensional cognition —
breaking down user states into interpretable axes (emotion, intention, reflection, etc.)
and eventually extending this into richer reasoning structures.

🙋‍♂️ About the Founder

The creator of this project is new to software development and building this as a learning journey.
The idea, direction, and philosophy of the system are clear —
but the technical implementation needs structure, cleanup, and professional guidance.

If you browse the code and think:

“Oh, this needs refactoring,”

“These modules should be reorganized,”

“This memory structure could be more robust,”

…you are exactly who is needed.

🤝 Looking For Collaborators

If you're a developer who is:

comfortable structuring Python projects

familiar with OpenAI API usage

able to refactor early-stage prototypes

interested in cognitive architectures

enjoy mentoring newer coders

or want to help shape a unique assistant model

…your contributions would be hugely appreciated.

Specifically, help is needed with:

🧩 Immediate Needs

organizing the repo properly

separating layers (LLM, memory, reasoning, interface)

improving the long-term memory system

adding tests and better error handling

building a simple front-end later

🚀 Future Features (If Interested)

adaptive scheduling & task placement

habit pattern learning

emotional trajectory modeling

richer dimensional axis reasoning

optional GUI or mobile client

💡 How the Current Prototype Works

Right now, the assistant:

Runs via console_assistant.py

Uses OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini) for replies

Stores:

short-term conversation history

long-term journal/emotional memory

permanent identity memory (“Founder Page”)

Builds prompts that combine:

Compassion Core

Dimensional Scaffold

Recent memories

Replies in a more grounded, personalized way than a standard model

It is primitive, but the foundations are here.

🗂️ Important Note

This repo is meant as a starting point.
This is not production code and should not yet be used as a real product.
Contributors are invited to help turn this into a clean, extensible system.

📨 Interested? Reach Out

If you'd like to collaborate, open an issue or a pull request.
Even small improvements would make a big impact at this stage.

Together, we can turn this prototype into something meaningful.
