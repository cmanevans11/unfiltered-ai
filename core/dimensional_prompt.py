10. Goals — What they aim to achieve short-term or long-term.
11. Meta-Stability — Keep reasoning coherent, grounded, and aligned with reality.

• Avoid hallucination  
• Preserve continuity across conversations  
• Help the user grow without pressure  
• Use the axes only to *interpret*, never to judge
